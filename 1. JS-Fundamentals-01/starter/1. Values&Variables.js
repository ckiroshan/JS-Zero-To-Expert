/**
 * Some rules for naming variables =>
 * Should be dome using camelCase.
 * can't start with number,
 * it can only contain numbers 123, letters, underscores _ or $ sign.
 * can't use reserved keyword. (new, function, this)
 * legal. (But not recommended to use),
 *   => 'name' is also a reserved keyword but can be used.
 *   => 'Brain' not start with a uppercase letter, but can be used. (Special purpose in OOP)
 * Make them as descriptive as possible
 * Variables that are all in uppercase are constants - (PI value won't change)
